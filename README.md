# Muval Vue 3 SPA Test

This is a clean Vue 3 project ready for you to set up a basic single-page
application (SPA) to consume the API you built in the Laravel backend test.


## Getting started


### Environment setup

1. Downlaod or clone this repos.
2. Install the base packages. You can install additional packages to assist.

```sh
npm install
```

3. Compile and hot-reload for development:
```sh
npm run dev
```

The app will now be accessible via your browser and update when you make
changes to the code.

4. Build away - read the details below for our expectations.

5. Save a zip of your revised code. Email this along with any set up
requirements to: nicole@muval.com.au
